From Plolty:
Music sets the tone for our mornings, days, and nights, whether weâ€™re washing dishes or partying. The following data set explores various parameters of songs in the Spotify library, including genre, danceability, and tempo.

Things to consider:

how can the facet plot be improved?
how can the trendline be improved?
is there a better way to show the correlations between energy and danceability of songs?
are there other interesting correlations to discover?
what other graphs can we use to analyze the data set?
