From Plotly:
Week 35 of Figure-Friday will accompany Plotly’s transition to MapLibre, bringing faster performance and increased stability to all of our map-type charts. Read the blog post written by Plotly’s very own, @nathandrezner, to learn more about the why, what, and when.

The data set we’ve chosen is the people-map.csv file, which represents the most visited person(s) Wikipedia page for each city or town from 2015-2019.
