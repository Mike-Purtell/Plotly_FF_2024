We’re excited to announce the first data set of the Figure Friday initiative. Every Friday Plotly will release a data set and a sample figure. The community will have one week to enhance that figure, build your own Plotly figure or create a Dash app.

This week’s data set comes from Workout Wednesday and it’s a sample superstore’s sales and profit.
